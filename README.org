* opam-ios

This repository contains a compiler for OCaml on iOS.

* Usage
First create a fresh switch, it must be 4.02.0:

*NOTE* This is important, installation of ~ocaml-xarm~ is a
destructive operation. In this context it means that the later
installation of ~ocaml-xarm~ will delete the existing compilers, hence
we make a switch just for this package.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ opam switch ios -A 4.02.0
#+END_SRC

Then add this repository with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ opam repository add ios git://github.com/fxfactorial/opam-ios
#+END_SRC

Now do:

*NOTE* This is a destructive install, hence I told you to make a
separate switch for this install.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ opam install ocaml-xarm
#+END_SRC

Now you can compile OCaml that will run on the iPhone!

* Example

Here is a stupid server, mostly useful to show how one can use the
Unix module with no problem on the iPhone.

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml -n
open UnixLabels

let () =
  let sock = socket ~domain:PF_INET ~kind:SOCK_STREAM ~protocol:0 in
  bind sock ~addr:(ADDR_INET (inet_addr_any, 3000));
  print_endline "About to listen";
  listen sock 5;
  let resp = "Thanks for the Test!\n" in
  while true do
    let (listen_sock, listen_addr) = accept sock in
    let buf = String.create 255 in
    (ignore (read listen_sock ~buf ~pos:0 ~len:255));
    print_endline buf;
    (ignore @@ write listen_sock ~buf:resp ~pos:0 ~len:(String.length resp - 1));
    Unix.close listen_sock
  done
#+END_SRC

Compile with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ocamloptrev -rev 8.3 unix.cmxa server.ml -o The_server
#+END_SRC

The -rev 8.3 refers to the iOS SDK. In this example I compiled for
8.3, note that this is just for paths, it will actually look for a
path like /Applications/Xcode.app... Funny enough, even though this
was for 8.3, the code will work below that as well, I tested it on 8.3
and iOS 7.1; Xcode6.3.2 will give you the 8.3 SDK.

And here's an example of it working:

* Issues
This won't work with other opam packages just yet, I am still working
on that. The only thing you'll have at your disposal for now is the
OCaml standard library, which does include unix.
* Acknowledgments
The real heroes are Gerd Stolpmann, awesome guys at Psellos.com;
special shout out to Jeffrey Scofield.

Also thanks to @whitequark for his ~opam-android~ repo. Although I
ended up going in a different approach, his repo was a great starting
point for me.
